# This fight is not for her alone

Marfa’s struggle is not only about Belarus, it is about the global right to speak freely, to study without fear, and to demand justice. Her story reflects the vulnerability of all students and academics when truth is silenced by repression. Marfa’s case is not isolated, her story is one of hundreds. But by learning, sharing, and standing in solidarity, we can join a movement that keeps her name alive and pressures for systemic change.
