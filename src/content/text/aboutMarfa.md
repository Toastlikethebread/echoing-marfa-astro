# The Story of Marfa Rabkova

## Background

 Marfa’s activism began as a student. She was detained as early as 2012 for joining peaceful marches, later forced to leave university in Minsk under political pressure. By 2019, she coordinated the volunteer network of Viasna Human Rights Centre, training students to monitor elections, report police violence, and deliver food to detainees. In September 2020, amid mass protests against fraudulent elections, Marfa was arrested. Over the next two years, she faced eleven charges and was eventually sentenced to nearly 15 years in prison—one of the harshest punishments ever given to a Belarusian activist.

## Her Current Situation

Marfa is now held in Women’s Penal Colony No. 4, where she endures overcrowding, poor sanitation, and denied medical treatment. Her health has severely deteriorated—exhaustion, dental pain, and chronic illness—yet her letters reveal remarkable resilience. She is more than a statistic: like us, she was once a student balancing studies, hopes, and friendships. She reminds us how easily lives like ours can be silenced by repression.
