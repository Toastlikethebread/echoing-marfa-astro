## Where can I learn more about Marfa?

Fighting for the release of Marfa and other Belarusian political prisoners is a cause championed by many organisations. These groups can serve as a great resource for anyone looking to learn more! We reccommend the following for anyone interested:

### [Viasna Human Rights Centre](https://spring96.org/en)

The human rights organisation where Marfa was working, this group has been working to contribute to the development of Belarusian Human Rights since 1996. Following Marfa's arrest, 6 other Viasna collaborators would be arrested and 4 still remain behind bars. Now proscribed an 'extremist formation' by the Belarusian government, the group continues to operate and track ongoing human rights abuses in Belarus. The #FreeViasna campaign is calling for the release of their imprisoned members, including Marfa.

### [Scholars at Risk (SAR)](https://www.scholarsatrisk.org)

Scholars at Risk is an international network of higher education institutions and indivuals with the mission to protect scholars and protect academic freedom. SAR documents attacks on academic freedom through its Academic Freedom Monitoring Project. Student Advocacy Seminars are organized in collaboration with University Faculty to provide the opportunity for students to engage in advocacy. It is from such a seminar at Monash University that the Echoing Marfa campaign originated.

### [Belarusian Student Union](https://zbsunion.org/en)

The Belarusian student union represents an effort by students to establish an independent intellectual community. Whilst currently operating underground within Belarus due to government repression, Belarusian expatriate students continue to represent the community abroad.
